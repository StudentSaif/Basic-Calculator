🧮 Simple Calculator (Python)

This is a beginner-friendly Python calculator project that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The project demonstrates the use of functions, conditional statements, error handling (try/except), and user input handling in Python.

🚀 Features

Supports basic operations:

➕ Addition

➖ Subtraction

✖️ Multiplication

➗ Division (with division by zero handling)

Uses separate functions for each operation (add, sub, mul, div).

Handles invalid inputs gracefully with try/except.

Interactive command-line interface for user input.
